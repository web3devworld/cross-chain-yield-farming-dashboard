   ```bash
   cd cross-chain-yield-farming-dashboard
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Set Up Environment Variables**:
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following:
     ```plaintext
     REACT_APP_API_URL=https://api.example.com
     ```
   - Replace `https://api.example.com` with your actual API endpoint.

5. **Start the Development Server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Usage

### Connecting Your Wallet
1. Open the dashboard in your browser.
2. Click the "Connect Wallet" button.
3. Approve the connection request in your wallet (e.g., MetaMask).
4. Once connected, your wallet address will be displayed.

### Selecting a Blockchain Network
1. Use the dropdown menu to select a blockchain network (e.g., Ethereum, Polygon).
2. The dashboard will fetch and display yield farming opportunities for the selected chain.

### Viewing Yield Farms
- Each yield farm card displays key details such as APR, TVL, and an "Invest Now" button.
- Hover over a card to see a subtle animation effect.

## Features Overview

### 1. Modular Components
The project uses a modular architecture with reusable components like `Header`, `ChainSelector`, and `YieldFarmList`.

### 2. Web3 Integration
The app integrates with Ethereum-compatible wallets using `ethers.js`. Wallet connection logic is centralized in the `WalletContext`.

### 3. API Caching
API requests are optimized using `React Query` to cache data and reduce redundant calls.

### 4. Error Handling
Comprehensive error handling ensures smooth user experience, even when APIs fail or wallets are disconnected.
